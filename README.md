Security Operations | Detection Engineering | Incident Response | Cloud Security

I design detection logic, investigate authentication abuse, analyze endpoint telemetry, and document structured incident response workflows across Windows, Linux, and cloud environments.

---

## Core Capabilities

• Investigate authentication anomalies (Windows, Linux, Cloud)  
• Analyze endpoint telemetry (Sysmon, Security Logs)  
• Detect brute-force, credential stuffing, and account takeover activity  
• Correlate multi-source logs for timeline reconstruction  
• Translate investigations into Sigma detection rules  
• Develop repeatable incident response playbooks  
• Automate triage using Python and Bash

## Detection Focus Areas

### Windows Endpoint
- 4624 / 4625 authentication analysis  
- Process creation and parent-child abuse  
- Office → PowerShell execution patterns  
- Registry persistence monitoring  

### Cloud Identity & IAM
- Suspicious API activity  
- Privilege escalation attempts  
- OAuth abuse detection  
- Geolocation anomaly analysis  

### Network Behavior
- Beaconing detection  
- Repeated outbound connection patterns  
- Command-and-control traffic analysis

## Detection Engineering

Sigma rules authored for:

- RDP brute-force detection  
- Encoded PowerShell execution  
- Suspicious Office child processes  

Focused on behavioral detection logic, signal clarity, and false-positive reduction.

---

## Automation

Log triage utilities for:

- Failed login aggregation  
- Suspicious parent-child process detection  
- Log parsing for investigation efficiency
